# Secure Photo Blur

Privacy-first photo anonymization — offline, open-source, no personal data collected.

## What it does

Blur faces and sensitive areas in photos before sharing them publicly. Automatic face detection finds faces for you; you can adjust, add, or remove regions manually.

## How it works

The whole thing is a static web page with no backend — you can switch to airplane mode and it still works (PWA, fully offline after first load), or open DevTools → Network on desktop and see for yourself that no photos are ever uploaded. There's no personal data collection, no auth; anonymous page-view analytics via Cloudflare Web Analytics (no cookies, no fingerprinting). Strict Content Security Policy, Referrer-Policy: no-referrer, and camera/mic/geolocation permissions are explicitly disabled. The code is open source and auditable — around 2,000 lines of Preact + TypeScript under a PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0 license — with face detection running locally through [@vladmandic/human](https://github.com/vladmandic/human) (BlazeFace), model weights bundled, no external requests at runtime.

## Blur methods

| Method | Security | How it works |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Mosaic | High | Pixelates to ~5x5 blocks — irreversible |
| Solid black | Maximum | Covers with solid black — zero information left |
| Solid average color | Maximum | Fills with region's average color — no structural detail |
| Gaussian blur | Low | Soft blur — research shows AI can reverse it |

## Supported formats

JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC/HEIF. All EXIF/GPS metadata is automatically stripped on export.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
